Hello,

I was scrolling through GitHub one day and stumbled upon this repo. 
I actively play Visual-Utopia currently (returned a year ago after 6 year hiatus, started in 2009), and was wondering if you are still active on GitHub to see this?
Another player (Grand Moff) and I (Percy/Inception) have been creating various tools to give to the community to help ease new players in without needing years of experience to compete.

The features listed here seem phenomenal, and I was wondering two things:
1) How do you execute the code to run in the game window? I'm only just learning how to code in JavaScript, and dont know much on the execution side, but would love to see how you have this working.
2) Is there be any chance down the line you would be willing to return to VU? We still have a decent playerbase (~40-50 players) with several new players appearing every month or so. A KD I lead is specifically targeting these new players for recruitment, and that has gone very well :)

Should you see this, thanks in advance for taking the time to read this, and any response would be appreciated. 
If you dont read this or choose to not reply, I hope you are doing well and living life to the fullest! :)
